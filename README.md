# money-vue

> A Vue.js project

This is my first project after building [a guitar tablature tracker](https://github.com/Strangebrewer/tab-tracker) by following [this FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4cRMaTDUI&t=544s). I'm learning Vue, Vuex, and BootstrapVue because we use them at work.
